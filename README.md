# Wordle-Project

This project focuses on analyzing the frequency and distribution of letters in a collection of words, with the goal of uncovering patterns and insights. The words used for analysis are drawn from the NYT's Wordle game. The project systematically breaks down the words into individual letters and examines the frequency of each letter's occurrence in various positions within the words. The analysis includes visualizations, statistical observations, and comparisons across different positions. The project provides valuable insights into letter distribution and frequency within words, which can have implications for strategy development when playing Wordle.

While this analysis was initially conducted for personal use, it has been recently formatted for public viewing and sharing. You can check it out [here](file:///Users/louisaswin/Library/Messages/Attachments/ed/13/D11820DA-B3CB-45C5-BE96-144356FBEA64/analysismarkdown.html)!

# Future Work 
This anaylsis is intended to be expanded upon. The goal of this analysis was to dictate a strong first guess and ideas for subsequent guesses predicated upon feedback (as I only play in hard mode) by having a general knowledge of letter frequency and usage. Currently, primarily only the figures are published with limited discussion but I hope to elaborate more on analysis/strategy in the future (i.e. putting my thoughts to paper). Moreover, I hope to conduct future analyses regarding:
- Frequencies of letters occuring within the same words 
- Double letter frequencies
- Common letter pairings, such as "TH", "ER", "ON"
- Most popular vowel and consonant pairings
- Frequencies of graphemes, prefixes, and suffixes 

These types of analyses are interesting to me as they expand beyond the game of wordle. Understanding letter frequency analysis, even within this limited context, can help aid in pattern recognition, benefiting tasks like spelling and other word-based games (e.g. the crossword, scrabble, etc.)

Future considerations should include the all possible guesses list.

# Presentation
Transforming this analysis to public viewing allowed further hone my data visualizations and document presentation through R Markdown. I tried to make the presentation match the theme by incorportaing NYT themes and fonts. This was easily the hardest part of the project. In the future I hope to enhance the presentation in the following ways:
- Work on making the graphs consistent with the NYT theme (this is already in progress, although the font is quite resistant).
- Address the issue of NYT-themed tables not appearing side by side.
