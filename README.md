# Wordle-Project

This project focuses on analyzing the frequency and distribution of letters in a collection of words, with the goal of uncovering patterns and insights. The words used for analysis are part of the NYT's Wordle game. The project systematically breaks down the words into individual letters and examines the frequency of each letter's occurrence in various positions within the words. The analysis includes visualizations, statistical summaries, and comparisons across different positions. The project provides valuable insights into letter distribution and frequency within words, which can have implications for strategy development when playing Wordle.

This anaylsis is intended to be expanded upon.
